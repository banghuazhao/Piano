### ✨ Features
- **🎹 7-Octave Keyboard**: Full piano range from C1 to B7 with smooth horizontal scrolling
- **🧭 Interactive Navigation**: Octave buttons and scroll slider for quick navigation
- **⚙️ Customizable Settings**: Adjustable key width, key name display options, and haptic feedback
- **🎵 Realistic Audio**: SoundFont-backed piano sound with low-latency playback
- **📱 Modern UI**: SwiftUI interface with responsive keys and smooth animations
- **🏗️ MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation with `@Observable` view models and Swift concurrency

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **📋 Pattern**: MVVM with Swift concurrency
- **🎛️ ViewModel**: `@Observable` and `@MainActor`-scoped for UI-safe state management
- **🔊 Audio**: `AVAudioEngine` + `AVAudioUnitSampler` for SoundFont playback
- **💾 State Management**: User preferences stored with `@AppStorage`

**🔄 Data Flow**:
- 📱 `PianoView` renders the scrollable keyboard and handles user interactions
- 🎚️ `PianoViewModel` manages key state, scroll position, and audio playback
- 🔊 `AudioEngine` service handles audio session and SoundFont loading
- ⚙️ `SettingsView` provides customization options with persistent storage

### 🛠️ Requirements
- 💻 Xcode 15 or later
- 📱 iOS 17 or later (SwiftUI `@Observable` macro)
- 🖥️ macOS Sonoma or later for development

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. 📥 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/banghuazhao/PianoFlow.git
cd PianoFlow
```
2. 🔧 Open the project in Xcode
```bash
open Piano.xcodeproj
```
3. ▶️ Select the `Piano` scheme and a simulator or device, then Run.

**📝 Note**: If you replace the SoundFont, put your `.sf2` file in `Piano/Sound/` and update the load call if needed.
